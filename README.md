# HitoriGame

As the name says, Hitori is a game, in this case a python program that allows you to play the famous asian on-paper game directly on your pc. 
One of my best friends and I developed it togheter as a university project, saving it as memory of all the work we put in on this project in our freshman year (We got full marks!).

## Things you'll need

+ Python 3.x or Higher
+ The downloaded folder HitoriGame

## How to run the game

In the HitoriGame folder, launch the main.py script and that's it!

## How to play

### Rules

The goal is to clean up the table from the duplicate numbers, so that in each row and column there is none.
Seems easy, but there is another rule, the "white" cells remaining must be linked horizontally or vertically, so that hipotetically you could connect all of them with a single pen line without lifting the penpoint.

### How to play

You can erase one number by just *left clicking* it, or you can mark a number with *right click* so that you not mistakly erase it. If you notice you erased a wrong number just *left click* it again. If you need a little help you can press *SPACEBAR* and the program will help you, also you can click *K* and the game will automatically mark all the numbers that can't be erased
